# About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm a computer science student based in the beautiful south of France, passionate about coding and learning new technologies.

## Background

Although i study computer science, i've self taught myself a majority of what i know.

### Technologies I'm Proficient In:
- Git 🌟
- C# ⚙️
- C++ 🖥️
- Rust 🦀
- Python (although it's not my favourite and has limited true use cases) 🐍

I didn't only write "Hello World" and make a number guessing game with those: i've made a bunch of projects with 'em, although most aren't public.
